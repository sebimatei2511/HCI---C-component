      Compare the visual metaphors and idioms and suggest the similar ones for a text-only interaction</h2>

    <p><a style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> and <a
        href="https://www.skype.com/en/" style="color: #00aff0; text-decoration: none;">Skype</a> are both graphical
      user interfaces (GUI) that use visual metaphors and idioms to create a familiar and intuitive experience for
      users. In contrast, a Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-only interface that relies on command input and
      output to interact with the system. Here are some comparisons between the visual metaphors and idioms used in <a
        style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> and <a
        href="https://www.skype.com/en/" style="color: #00aff0; text-decoration: none;">Skype</a> and suggestions for
      similar ones for a text-only interaction:
    </p>

    <h4 style="font-size: 15px;">
      <a style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;" href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> "Server" and "Channel" are used to organize and group conversations and users.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Idiom:</strong> Colored dots next to user's names indicate their status (online, idle, do not
        disturb, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Suggestion for CLI:</strong> Use a simple folder structure to organize and group commands and
        responses. Use a prompt that indicates the user's status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="font-size: 15px;">
      <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" style="color: #00aff0; text-decoration: none;">Skype</a>:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> "Contacts" and "Groups" are used to organize and group conversations and users.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Idiom:</strong> Green checkmark next to a contact's name indicates that they are online.</li>
      <li><strong>Suggestion for CLI:</strong> Use a simple list of commands and responses to organize and group
        conversations and users. Use a prompt that indicates whether the user is online or offline.</li>
    </ul>

    </br>

    <p>To summarize, visual metaphors and idioms are not relevant for a text-only interface such as a CLI. However, it
      is possible to use simple folder structures and lists of commands and responses to arrange and group users and
      conversations. To provide additional context, prompts can be utilized to convey the user's availability to
      receive messages.</p>

      Discuss the cognitive overload</h2>

    <p>Cognitive overload occurs when a person is presented with too much information or too many tasks to process at
      once, leading to a decrease in productivity and an increase in errors. This can be particularly problematic in
      special conditions or contexts, such as delivering an academic presentation or attending a specific meeting at
      late hours, where individuals may already be experiencing additional stress or fatigue. Here are some ways in
      which cognitive overload may impact the use of <a style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;"
        href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/"
        style="color: #00aff0; text-decoration: none;">Skype</a> in these special conditions:</p>


    <p><strong>Delivering an academic presentation:
      </strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cognitive overload can occur if the presenter is trying to manage too many channels or conversations at
        once, leading to missed messages or lost focus.</li>
      <li>To reduce cognitive overload, the presenter may want to limit the number of channels they are monitoring
        during the presentation, or assign a moderator to manage the conversations for them.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Attending a specific meeting at late hours:</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cognitive overload can occur if the participant is already experiencing fatigue, making it more difficult to
        process information and communicate effectively.</li>
      <li>To reduce cognitive overload, the participant may want to limit their use of visual elements, such as emojis
        or animated GIFs, which can be distracting and add to cognitive load. Additionally, using keyboard shortcuts
        and other productivity tools can help reduce the time it takes to respond to messages, reducing the overall
        cognitive load.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Overall, in special conditions or contexts where cognitive overload may be a concern, it is important to
      simplify the user interface and limit distractions as much as possible to reduce cognitive load. Additionally,
      using productivity tools and assigning moderators to manage conversations can help manage cognitive load and
      improve productivity.</p>

      margin: 0;" id="section-5">5. How
      the empiric laws (Fitts’, Hick’s, Steering) might be reconsidered/adapted in the context of multi-device
      interaction?</h2>

    <p><strong>Fitts' law</strong> predicts the pointing (movement) average time as a function of the distance to and
      width of the given target. In a multi-device interaction, the distance to the target may vary depending on the
      device being used, and the size of the target may also differ. Therefore, it may be necessary to consider the
      relative distance and size of targets across different devices to accurately predict the time required to
      complete a task.</p>
    <p><strong>Hick's law</strong> states that the time required to make a decision increases with the number of
      alternatives. In a multi-device interaction, the number of alternatives may also vary depending on the device
      being used. For example, a desktop computer may have more options and features available than a mobile device.
      Therefore, it may be necessary to account for the differences in the number of alternatives across devices to
      accurately predict the time required to make a decision.</p>
    <p><strong>Steering law</strong> predicting the time of moving the hand through a “tunnel” having the length D and
      width S. In a multi-device interaction, the empirical Steering law needs to be adapted by accounting for factors
      such as device switching time, input modality, and screen size and resolution. For example, if a user is working
      on a task that requires using <a style="color: #7289da; text-decoration: none;"
        href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> on a laptop and <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/"
        style="color: #00aff0; text-decoration: none;">Skype</a> on a mobile device, the empirical Steering law needs
      to consider the additional time it takes for the user to switch between the two devices. </p>
    </br>
    <p>Overall, it is important to consider the unique characteristics of each device and the context in which it is
      being used when applying the empirical laws of Fitts', Hick's, and Steering to multi-device interaction. By
      doing so, designers can create interfaces that are optimized for different devices and provide a seamless user
      experience across devices.</p>
